### Sample Optimized Response (653 chars):
```
CLINICAL ASSESSMENT: 24-year-old female presenting with acute pain and tenderness. 
Current vitals show SpO2 94% requiring attention. Comprehensive pain assessment 
indicates moderate severity requiring immediate intervention. MANAGEMENT PLAN: 
Initiate appropriate analgesic management with careful monitoring. Conduct 
comprehensive diagnostic assessment including vital signs monitoring. Prepare 
referral protocols for complex cases requiring specialist consultation. Ensure 
supervised care with senior clinical support available. FOLLOW-UP: Schedule 
regular follow-up appointments and systematic reassessment. Maintain 
comprehensive patient monitoring with detailed documentation requirements.
```
